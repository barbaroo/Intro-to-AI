    "## Clue Game with Propositional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use propositional logic to deduce information in a game of Clue. The game of Clue involves players trying to determine which character committed a crime, in which room, and with which weapon. Players are given a set of cards that provide clues about which characters, rooms, and weapons are innocent. By process of elimination and deduction, they must then figure out the correct answer.\n",

    "We will use the `logic.py` module to represent logical sentences and perform model checking to evaluate these sentences."
